# Temperature-and-Humidity-Data-logging
Temperature and Humidity Data logging to SD card using SD card module and Arduino UNO

# Components required
  1.Arduino Uno
  2.SD Card Module
  3.DHT22/DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
  4.SD Card (Higher than 8GB)
  5.Breadboard(if required)
  6.Connecting wires
  
# Prerequisites:
 1. Arduino IDE [get it here](https://arduino.en.softonic.com/)
 2. You need to manually add DHT library to Arduino IDE as it is not included by default. You can ignore it if you have already included it. Otherwise you can do it following the     steps below.
      a).Open Arduino IDE
      b).Go to Sketch >> Include Library >> Manage Libraries
      c).Search for DHT sensor library and install it
